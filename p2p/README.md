# PPPP Peer to Peer Protocol
The PPPP peer to peer communication protcool is integral to connecting Wansview applications to cameras. To our knowledge, this protocol is not officially documented anywhere, so it has required significant reverse engineering 
in order to properly interact with cameras through it. Fortunately, this protocol has been researched extensively by [Paul Marrapese](https://hacked.camera/) and there are other published resources which have aided in the RE process:
