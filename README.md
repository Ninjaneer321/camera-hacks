# Wi-Fi Camera Hacking

This repostitory will contain custom tools we have created, data we have collected, and research notes we have compiled pertaining to vulnerability research of Wi-Fi cameras. We will be presenting our research at the [DEF CON 32 IoT Village](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-creator-talks.html#54600) and will publish our material to this repository shortly afterwards.
