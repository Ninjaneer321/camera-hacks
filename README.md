# Wi-Fi Camera Hacking

This repostitory contains custom tools we have created, data we have collected, and research notes we have compiled pertaining to vulnerability research of [Wansview](https://www.wansview.com) Wi-Fi cameras and their firmware along with the [AJCloud](https://www.ajcloud.net) IoT device management platform. We presented our research at the [DEF CON 32 IoT Village](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-creator-talks.html#54600).

The final version of our slides which were presented at DEF CON can be found [here](what_to_expect_dc_iot_2024.pdf).
